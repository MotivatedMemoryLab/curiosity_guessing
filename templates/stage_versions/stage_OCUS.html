        <h3><strong>Welcome to the Video Guessing Experiment by the Adcock Lab at Duke University!</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Please carefully review the instructions below and on the following page about how to navigate the task.
            <strong>These will not be repeated and you will not be able to return to the instructions once you start
                the task.</strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>How to Guess</strong></h3>
        <p>
            While you watch these short videos, we want you to <strong>actively guess what you think the drawing is going
            to turn into.</strong> For example, as you watch a video you might first see the line move upwards and maybe
            you think it's going to be a mountain. But after a couple more moments, the drawing starts
            to look more like a boat. So, throughout the video you should have submitted two guesses into the
            text box provided, first "mountain" followed by "boat" and so forth over the course of the video.
        </p>
        <p>
            We expect your guess might evolve or change over the video and we are interested in what that process looks like.
            Try to guess <strong>each time you have a different idea of what the drawing is going to be, at least TWICE per video.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            As soon as you begin to enter text into the provided text box, the video will pause so you
            have time to record your response. To submit your guess, type out your response and hit the <strong>ENTER</strong>
            key.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try to use the most common English words for your guesses. For example, if you see an image of a hamster
            write "hamster" instead of "animal" or "Winter White Dwarf hamster".
        </p>
        <p>
            When watching these videos please try your best to <strong>focus your attention on the line
            to give us the best understanding of how and when you can identify what it being drawn.</strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>How to Answer Questions About the Videos</strong></h3>
        <p>
            After you have submitted your guess, you will be asked to answer a few questions about the video
            (e.g. How much do you want to see the rest of the drawing?).
        </p>
        <p>
            You must make a response to <strong>all</strong> questions on the screen. All sliding scales will <strong>start at the midpoint.</strong>
            <strong>If your response is at the midpoint, you still have to click the sliding circle to register a response.</strong>
            You will be prompted to answer all the questions if you happen to forget one.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>How to Get Back to the Videos</strong></h3>
        <p>
            After responding to the questions, you get to decide whether you would like to <strong>continue watching the current
            video ("Continue Watching")</strong> or <strong>skip to the end ("Skip to End")</strong> by
            selecting the appropriate button. If you skip to the end, the video will be fast-forwarded to the final drawing.
            Before you can move to the next video, you will first be asked to answer the questions you would answer at
            the end of each video.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Press Next to continue reading instructions.</strong>
        </p>

        <button id = "startButton" class = "button" @click = "startExp">Next</button>
    </div>
    <div id = "startExp" >
        <h3><strong>How to Move from Video to Video</strong></h3>
        <p>
            At the end of a trial, you will have the option to <strong>replay the video ("Replay Video")</strong>, this time with
            <u>no interruptions</u> or <strong>move to the next video ("Next Video")</strong>. To select either option,
            you must first type in your final guess and again, make a response to <strong>ALL</strong> slider scales.
            You, again, will be prompted to answer all of the questions if you happen to forget one.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>How to End or Continue the Game</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Once you've watched the 25 pre-selected videos, you can choose to <strong>continue watching more videos</strong>
            if you want to. These additional videos will function just like the previous ones except now <strong>you will
            have the option to stop the game</strong> either during the video (at pause points) or after the
            video has finished.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, you may watch as many or as few of the videos as you want to. These additional videos
            do not impact your compensation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><strong>Practical Information for Playing the Game</strong></h4>
        <ul>
              <li>You must make a response to <strong>all</strong> questions on the screen. <strong>If your response is
                  at the midpoint, you still have to click the sliding circle to register a response.</strong></li>
              <li>You will receive alerts that you are <strong>halfway</strong> through the task and when you have
            <strong>5</strong> videos left to go. Again, we anticipate the game taking about 25-30 minutes to complete.</li>
              <li>Depending on your browser and internet connection, sometimes a video will freeze for a handful of seconds.
                 If this happens, please <strong>DO NOT try to hit the Refresh button or move backwards in the task.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>How to Start!</strong></h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Videos will start playing automatically when you hit the button to advance (including the "Start"
                button below).</strong>

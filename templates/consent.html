                        You are being asked to take part in a research study at Duke University to study how people engage with novel information.

                        WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about how interest develops in humans and how they can impact choices and learning.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>
                        WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY?
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>
                        In this study, you will complete computer tasks that will examine how information impacts your decision making.
                        You will watch and interact with animated videos of line drawings. These drawings will be simple objects or animals.
                        Interactions could include guessing what the item being drawn is, rating how the drawing makes you feel,
                        and/or deciding if you would like to continue watching the video. After you complete the task,
                        you will be asked to fill out some questionnaires and answer questions about the task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experiment will be conducted on a computer, and your decisions will be recorded using a keyboard and/or mouse.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>
                        HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Your participation in this study will take one session that will take about 55 minutes to complete. Your participation is voluntary.
                        You may choose to end your participation at any time for any reason. If you decide to stop participating in the study, you can close the browser window.
                        Questions on the questionnaires may be skipped.

                        WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THIS STUDY?
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>
                        We do not anticipate any risks to you for completing the study. None of the stimuli used in this experiment will be threatening, offensive, or stressful.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>
                        WHAT ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY?
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>
                        In order to protect your confidentiality, your data will be kept in locked, password-protected files on restricted-access servers maintained by the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience.
                        You will be assigned an arbitrary subject number that we will use throughout this study. We will collect your Prolific or MTurk ID number to ensure you are only enrolled in the study once and compensate you for participation.

                    <p>
                        Data without your MTurk or Prolific ID may be used for future research or shared with other researchers.

                        WHAT ABOUT COMPENSATION?

                    <p>
                        You will be compensated $9.00 for completion. You may only complete this study ONCE.
                        You may skip any questions or withdraw at any time, but you must reach the end of the study and enter in your MTurk or Prolific ID in order to be compensated.

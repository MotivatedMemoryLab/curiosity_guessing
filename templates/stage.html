        <p>
            <strong>Welcome to the Video Experiment by the Adcock Lab at Duke University!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please carefully review the instructions below and on the following page about how to navigate the task.
            <strong>These will not be repeated and you will not be able to return to the instructions once you start
                the task.</strong>
        </p>
            In each video you watch, there will be randomly placed pauses, <strong>between 1 - 3 per video,</strong>
            where we will ask you to answer a couple questions about the video (e.g. How much do you want to see the
            rest of the drawing?).
        <p>
        <p>
            We will also ask you to make a guess about what you think the drawing will be. We expect your guess might
            evolve or change over the video and we are interested in what that process looks like. If you do not have a
            guess to make, simply write "idk" or "none".
        </p>
        <p>
            Try to use the most common English words for your guesses. For example, if you see an image of a hamster
            write "hamster" instead of "animal" or "Winter White Dwarf hamster".
        <p>
            When watching these videos please try your best to <strong>focus your attention on the drawing</strong>
            to give us the best understanding of how and when you can identify what it being drawn.
        </p>

        <button id = "startButton" class = "button" @click = "startExp">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id = "startExp" >
        <p>
            <strong>Videos will start playing automatically when you hit the button to advance (including the "Start"
                button below).</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>To continue playing the video after it's been paused</strong>, you must <u>answer all 4 questions</u>
            and then <strong>press the Continue Button.</strong> You will be prompt to answer all 4 questions if you happen
            to forget one.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>To advance to the next video</strong>, you must first <u>type in your final guess</u> and <u>move ALL
            slider scales</u>. After these things are done the <strong>"Next Video" button will take you to the next video.</strong>
            You, again, will be prompt to answer all 4 questions if you happen to forget one.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will receive alerts that you are <strong>halfway</strong> through the task and when you have
            <strong>5</strong> videos left to go. Again, we anticipate the task taking about 30-35 minutes to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on you browser and internet connection, sometimes a video will freeze for a handful of seconds.
            If this happens, please <strong>do not try to hit the Refresh button or move backwards in the task.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Press <strong>start</strong> to begin the task.
